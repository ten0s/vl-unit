Visual Lisp Unit testing framework is a unit test tool for Visual Lisp.

This is a very simple unit testing framework I've built for my father. Unfortunately, it  doesn't seem that he's got the idea what it is all about. I released it in hope that it might be useful for someone else.

Files are located at http://vl-unit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/. First download files to your computer, evaluate vl-unit.lsp, then you can evaluate tests such as rock-scissors-paper.lsp or tests.lsp.

Feel free to contact me if something is not clear or you find it useful and you need some help.
